# Web-Social

## Description
In this challenge, we were required to assume the role of an imaginary social media network. As a user in the network, the end user can add themselves to the site, make comments (posts), and also react to the comments. The goal was to provide an interactive user experience while alsogiving the developer an understanding as to how the other popular social networks such as Facebook, Twitter/X, and TikTok are used in their day-to-day activities. 

## Installation
Modified JS scripts for the exercise.

Required the installation of express.js and mongoose to implement seeding and organization of the information contained within the code.

Used Insomnia to test out the social network API routes and use of controllers and models.

Completed code pushed to GitHub.

Application and demonstration done on ScreenCastify.  Links are provided further down in this README.

## Usage
The end user will be able to run the application from the CLI in Visual Studio Code. Once the command "npm start" is entered, the port 3001 will be run, thus making the assignment ready to be tested on Insomnia. From there, the user can manipulate the database as needed.
